# Week 4 Final Project Status Update
## Prepared by Elizabeth Owen (Individual)

### Project Title: Prevalence of Slow Street Ordinances in Health & Fitness Vulnerable LA Neighborhoods
Week 2 Proposal URL: https://github.com/eaowen/up206a-elizabeth/blob/main/Final%20Project/Owen_GroupAssignment%231.pdf

So far, I am really enjoying the project now that we are further along in the course. I feel relatively comfortable thus far importing and manipulating data within our notebook.
I think the hardest part thus far was narrowing down my geographic scope and level of data. I was initially really hoping to use census tract level data on health and obesity.
However, census tract data seems to be too large a file to import, and there is a lack of census-tract level data collection.
The most recent dataset relating to obesity, heart disease, and other morbidities was from UCLA in 2014, which seems adequate for the purposes of this project.
I have shapefiles of the City's parks and open space from LA Geohub to add as well. 

I also was initially worried about finidng the slow streets data, however I have since been able to export data as a KML file that works within Python.
The data was from an open-source website that advocates for slow streets in LA, available here: https://streetsforall.org/covid19
I still intend to evaluate which is the best data to use for measuring public health vulnerability. I have yet to plot the SimmonsLOCAL perceptions of health data I found on SimplyAnalytics because I need to re-export at zip code level.
I also hope to incoporate potential Health Vulnerability Index scores, as well as perhaps overlay COVID vulberability data.

My biggest concerns are about combining all our datasets into one map. I tried starting this using the Week 4 lab exercises, however the scale of the data felt off. 

Other minor concerns I have are about how to best format our maps (how to modify legends, labeling) as well as just the general level of analysis expected for our final project.
I have ideas about doing related buffers/distance to parks data within my project, however most of this data is already available as a layer from LA GEOHub.
