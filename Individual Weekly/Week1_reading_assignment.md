This article examines how open data, using a Shenzhen (China) case study, can provide quantatative analysis on characteristics of transit-oriented development (TODs) and successful TOD attributes.
The research produced from this case used regression models that studied what indicators that will make a TOD successful, such as transit ridership, rider demographics, people co-located within a station area, and neighborhood age. 
Open-data can help planners re-evaluate what guidelines and principles are used when planning for transit-oriented development, and data can be used to better predict successful transit use post-development.
The article shows that simplified overlaying of data, such as a simplified walkability score, is not sufficient enough to predit TOD success. Finally, the research conducted through the University of Hong Kong serves as a strong argument for conducting more qualatative transit rider & TOD resident data, either through focus groups, rider surveys, etc.
Finally, transportation planners and system analysts need to spend more time on developing an effective TDM system that allows for greater cross-tab  analysis between trip/route data and rider socioeconomic/qualatative data.

I chose this article specifically because my primary concentration is Housing (CEDH), however I hope to also complete or finish the Transportation Policy & Planning (TPP) coourses while at UCLA.
From the practioner's perspective, I never understood the analysis that went into deciding where and what kind of TODs should be built.
TODs are a hot buzz-word that planners seem to throw around without actually providing significant data or analysis behind why a site would benefit most from TOD.
I also found it fascinating how they acknowledged that there were limits to their data and that quantatative data alone would not be sufficient in predict TOD outcomes.
Planners seem to think that either quantatative or qualatative data - rarely both, since data collection is timely and costly- is sufficient, and the article makes a strong cases for both methods of data collection and integration within TDM plans.
