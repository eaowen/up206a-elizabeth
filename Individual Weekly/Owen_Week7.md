In undergrad, my urban design coursework primarily focused on analyzing figure ground maps for the prevalnce of sprawl through street networks, and we specifically focused on old European cities as a comparisson. The cul-de-sac style of Type E has had the greatest increase over the study period, up 17% to 2014, and it looks like the biggest increases were in the 1990s through 2008 "McMansion" development era.
