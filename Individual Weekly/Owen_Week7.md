I chose Adam's article on street network sprawl to prepare for this week, and I really enjoyed it! In undergrad, my urban design coursework primarily focused on analyzing figure ground maps for the prevalnce of sprawl through street networks, and we specifically focused on old European cities as a comparisson. The cul-de-sac style of Type E has had the greatest increase over the study period, up 17% to 2014, and it looks like the biggest increases were in the 1990s through 2008 "McMansion" development era. I think that overall, sprawl is one of the greatest threats to climate change and planners must creatively rehabilitate existing street networks to be more sustainable and promote micromobility. The question is, is it too late in the US? Part of me thinks so due to the inheritent nature of our suburban development- we would need signficant form-based code density to occur in the areas in between highly populated cities and suburbs, that way a more grid-like street network is semi-achievable. 

One of my questions for Adam would be if traffic/city planners should be required to meet certain compliance levels on implementing street types? I wonder if this will just create ideal complete streets on paper, but in reality new grid netwoeks are never built since there isn't room.
