Week 3 Reading Assignment

I chose the article focusing on the use of Isochrone mapping in evaluating mode-choice, which was the motivation for our lecture.
I really liked how the article draws reference to older twentieth-century methods of cartography, and how the way we map cities has changed based on our use of the urban grid and walkability metrics in design.
The reading touched a lot on how we discuss time, mobility, and accessibility in different contexts: time in Los Angeles often feels much longer, as a transit dependent, than in San Francisco.
I persoanlly feel that there needs to better emphasis in mode choice and the fluctuation between first-last mile modes in Google Maps. If you can suggest to users which mobility mode, based on your use patterns/variety in modes, than I think transit/mobility service providers can better expand their offerings tp the riders who need increased service.
