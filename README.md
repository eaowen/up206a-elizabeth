Winter 2021 206a repository, Elizabeth Owen

**Welcome to my repository!**


My name is Elizabeth Owen and I am a first year MURP student. My concentration is within Housing (CEDH), however I also hope to maybe complete the Transportation Planning courses. I also am enrolled in the Food Studies Graduate Certificate Program. Outside of UCLA, I work as a Planning Intern with Steer where I focus on TMO/TDM management for Warner Center and Burbank's TMO.

My interests within planning primarily lie within housing (transit-oriented development, ADUs/emerging housing trends), however I also have interests in regional transportation planning, universal design, tactical urbanism, and public health-oriented planning/design.

My goals for this course are primarily to learn Python. Coding has always felt extremely intimidating to me! I have prior experience using Esri products (ArcGIS Pro, StoryMaps, WebApp Builder), however I would like to be less dependent on expensive software licenses.

**Some group project ideas for this course include:**

Topic |Idea
------|----
Affordable Housing | Mapping non-profit housing development in the City of L.A.
Housing | Mapping ADU permit applications/units built in City of L.A.
COVID-19 | Overlaying Business Improvement Disticts (BIDs) with return-to-work data
Housing/Community Development | Overlaying newly constructed housing units with transit priority areas and seeing displacement/gentrification
COVID-19 | Access to parks, street closures and COVID-19 rates, transit dependency
Food Studies | Mapping LA County grocerry stores, obesity and health problem rates
Public Safety | Overlaying crime data with something (perhaps CPTED design principles, another topic).
