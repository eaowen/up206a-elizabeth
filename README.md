Winter 2021 206a repository, Elizabeth Owen

Welcome to my repository! 

My name is Elizabeth Owen and I am a first year MURP student. My concentration is within Housing (CEDH), however I also hope to maybe complete the Transportation Planning courses. I also am enrolled in the Food Studies Graduate Certificate Program. Outside of UCLA, I work as a Planning Intern with Steer where I focus on TMO/TDM management for Warner Center and Burbank's TMO.

My interests within planning primarily lie within housing (transit-oriented development, ADUs/emerging housing trends), however I also have interests in regional transportation planning, universal design, tactical urbanism, and public health-oriented planning/design.

My goals for this course are primarily to learn Python. Coding has always felt extremely intimidating to me! I have prior experience using Esri products (ArcGIS Pro, StoryMaps, WebApp Builder), however I would like to be less dependent on expensive software licenses.
